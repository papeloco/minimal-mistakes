Since 1985, Camp Opportunity has run a summer program dedicated to serving children aged 8-11 who have been victims of abuse and neglect. These children often, unfortunately, live in unreliable households where computer access and ability to follow-through is limited. If you are overwhelmed by email, these families have that problem tenfold as they battle income stability, mental health issues, and substance abuse. When enrolling our campers in Camp Opportunity, there are some parts of the enrollment process where we need engagement from the families -- reaching these homes and getting them to submit a form requires emails, texts, phone calls, physical mail -- and we need an all-of-the above solution so that our staff and volunteers don’t go nuts trying to collect and consolidate information from each of these places.

> Camp Opportunity -- and camps, schools, hospitals, doctors offices, sports leagues, charities, and governments around the world -- needs to enroll and gather information from its clients, members, and volunteers. 


## Why paper? ##

While online forms are easy to build, submit, and record -- paper remains the most broadly accessible method for gathering and sharing information. A form built in Adobe by a professional lays out and prints nicely, but as soon as it’s on paper, it’s hard to consolidate without data entry and database management.
