Consolidate web, scanned paper, and text entries into a single database. Data quality checks are performed and ambiguities can be resolved by algorithms or by the end user -- sometimes showing the raw entry (image or text) next to the digital field. Forms that satisfy quality checks are then sent to downstream systems.
