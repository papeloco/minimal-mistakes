Itâ€™s like WordPress for forms.

The *Form Builder*, a web form generator (like Google Forms) helps the user define the fields they need to collect. They can build the form from scratch or use a provided template. The system auto-senses and recommends common input blocks, like names and addresses.

Behind the scenes, an algorithm takes the fields and intelligently lays them out into a page. As the user builds the form, the user can see a preview of the physical form -- this lets them organize content to improve layout.
