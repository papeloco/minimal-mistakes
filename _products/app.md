The app performs handwriting-to-text transcription. Machine learning algorithms do all the heavly lifting -- the user can be prompted to address ambiguities. The form image may be retained for quality control. Because the form was built by the Papelo Builder, the layout of the form is known, and all fields can be identified precisely.
