The Form Publisher builds and hosts web forms that may be accessed from a web browser or mobile app. Clients may save their progress and share the blank, partial, or completed form with third parties through a link, paper, or automated text. When printed, the form is rendered with QR codes that helps uniquely identify the entry. When sent through text, a chatbot can verify fields and/or collect missing information.
